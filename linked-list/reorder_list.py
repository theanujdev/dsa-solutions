# Reorder List (Medium)
# Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:

# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head) -> None:
        # find middle
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # reverse second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            temp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = temp

        # merge two halfs
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2
